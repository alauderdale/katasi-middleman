					Our Story
				%p
					%strong
						On May 8, 2008, Dave Sueper, a father of two, and the Director of Engineering for a small, Denver-based telecom company left work for a lunch meeting. As he pulled out of the parking lot he was hit by a distracted 16 year old driver and was instantly killed. Scott Tibbitts, the founder of Katasi, was scheduled to meet Dave later that afternoon. 
				%p
					Scott was deeply affected by the tragedy; like Sueper, he was a father of two, and he realized it easily could have been him in the accident. The event gave Scott the motivation to solve this problem. Scott brought together a team of successful entrepreneurs to build a solution to end distracted driving.
